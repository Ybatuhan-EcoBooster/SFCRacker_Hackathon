# Project DescriptionüìÑ:
Imagine you are walking through a very dark corridor. Suddenly, you notice a very bright light. At the end of the corridor, you see a bright, loud, welcoming arcade machine‚Äîthe one you want to play right away.

Similarly, amid the dull, boring work, you encounter Arkadash. "Arkadas" means friend.

## How does it work?
For the analysis of eight companies (the database can be easily expanded to a full list), you can choose and generate the report. The data is mathematically clustered into a user-friendly document‚Äîintuitive and easy to change later.

## What is inside?
Arkadash is run on Python (Streamlit is used for front-end development, and the Python pdfminer library is used to extract specific parts of the SFCR reports of the companies, which is considered an essential part of the backend development. For another part of the backend development, the "re" library was used to identify patterns to extract specific parts of the pdf file properly.

## Why is it so innovative?
The Arkadash group aims to provide efficient and easy-to-adjust solutions to the particular problem without using complex methods. As it is clearly understandable, only three main libraries were used, making it easier for the company in case they wish to make adjustments to the source code, considering the fact that these mentioned libraries are easy to access.

## Streamlit Library üíª
**Streamlit:** : I made some part of my project on Streamlit. It provided many tools for achieving my project's visualization.
```RUN COMMAND
  python -m streamlit run Main.py
  #It is opening of Local Host
```
